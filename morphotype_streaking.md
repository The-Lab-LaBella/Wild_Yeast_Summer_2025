# Background

## Identifying yeast
This week, your plate may have multiple different things growing on it. That may include yeast, molds, and potentially some bacteria.

You will first need to identify what is on your plate. Below are some general ways to distinguish yeast from bacteria

- Translucent/flat colonies are typically bacteria
- Super shiny colonies tend to be bacteria
- Smaller-sized colonies tend to be bacteria

We can also place the plate under the microscope to see if we can identify the cell type

Take a look at this website to see if you can learn to spot the yeast: https://www.rowleylab.com/identifying-yeast-agar 


## Identifying yeast morphotypes

You may also have multiple different morphotypes of yeast. A **morphotype** is a yeast with an observable morphology. You will want to sample 1 of each morphotype you find. 

You will streak out one morphotype into each wedge on the plate.

# Protocol

### Required Materials 
-	YPD plates (1 plate can accomodate up to 4 morphotypes)
-	Inoculating loop

1.	Split YPD plates into 4 wedges, one for each distinct morphotype. Label the plate with sample information on plate and morphotype letter or number.
2.	Streak the morphotype to its respective wedge on your plate. Use the streaking method with which you are most comfortable. 
3.	Store upside down at room temperature (unless drippy then store upright)
4.	Watch for single colony growth.
