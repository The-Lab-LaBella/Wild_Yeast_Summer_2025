# Background

## Identifying yeast
This week, your plate may have multiple different things growing on it. That may include yeast, molds, and potentially some bacteria.

You will first need to identify what is on your plate. Below are some general ways to distinguish yeast from bacteria

- Translucent/flat colonies are typically bacteria
- Super shiny colonies tend to be bacteria
- Smaller-sized colonies tend to be bacteria

We can also place the plate under the microscope to see if we can identify the cell type

Take a look at this website to see if you can learn to spot the yeast: https://www.rowleylab.com/identifying-yeast-agar 


## Identifying yeast morphotypes

You may also have multiple different morphotypes of yeast. A **morphotype** is a yeast with an observable morphology. You will want to sample 1 of each morphotype you find. 

You will streak out one morphotype into each wedge on the plate.

**TIP** Try to get as many squiggles on the last section as possible. 
**TIP** Get a new inoculating loop or toothpick for each pass

# Protocol

### Required Materials 
-	YPD plates (1 plate can accommodate up to 4 morphotypes)
-	Inoculating loops

1.  Circle the 2-4 yeast colonies you will sample from your original plate and label them with a letter
2.	Split YPD plates into 4 wedges, one for each distinct morphotype. Label the plate with sample information and each wedge with the morphotype letter.
3.	Streak the morphotype to its respective wedge on your plate. See the figure above for directions. 
4.	Store upside down at room temperature. 
6.	Watch for single colony growth.
