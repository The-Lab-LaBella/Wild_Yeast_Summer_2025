# June 11th - Diluting and Plating

This week we will be plating your liquid culture onto solid Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) plates.

## Background

### YPD

YPD is a "complete" medium, meaning that it contains everything most yeast need to grow. 

The typical makeup of YPD is
- 1% Yeast Extract - Busted open yeast cells containing essential nutrients like amino acids, peptides, vitamins, and carbohydrates
- 2% Peptone - Partially digested proteins from meat, plants, or yeast. The main components are tryptophan, lysine, arginine, histidine, methionine, and phenylalanine.
- 2% Glucose - Sugar source

### Liquid vs solid culture

**Liquid Culture Uses**
- Uniform access to nutrients and aeration
- Large-scale growth
- Quantitative growth at lag, log, and stationary phase

**Liquid Culture Phenotypes**
- Flocculation - cells that clump together and settle out of the culture.
- Filamentation - shift to elongated cells that form filaments.
- Biofilm - a community of cells that attach to a surface.

**Solid Culture Uses**
- Isolation of pure colonies
- Easier to handle, store, and transfer
- Observe phenotypes such as size, color, texture, and more.

**Solid Culture Phenotypes**
- Colonies come in many different sizes, shapes, colors, and textures.
- Smooth - colonies usually made by _S. cerevisiae_
- Spoked - colonies with radial structures
- Ringed - colonies with rings of growth
- Lacy/Coralline - colonies with raised uneven surfaces
- Mountainous - colonies with raised surfaces
- Velvet - colonies with velvety surfaces

## Record Observations

The first thing you will do in lab today, is record what your two cultures and controls look like. 

Take note of color, bubbles, and any other phenotypes you see. 

## Dilution and Plating

### Required Materials

- Two 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes per sample
- Two aliquots of 990 ul sterile H20 per sample
- One YPD plate per sample
- Sterile glass beads

### Procedure

1.	Label two 1.5mL tubes for serial dilution for each sample. (1:100 and 1:10,000)
2.	Label the outer edge of the bottom of one YPD plate per sample with the sample ID 
3.	Add 990uL sterile H2O to each tube
4.	Vortex 5mL sample tubes and add 10μL to the first dilution tube. (1:100 dilution) 
5.	Vortex the first dilution tube and add 10μL to the second dilution tube. (1:10,000 final dilution)
6.	Pour ~10-15 sterile glass beads into the lid of the labeled plate. 
7.	Flip the plate with the lid on and pipette 100μL of vortexed 1:10,000 diluted sample (step 4) onto the glass beads. Replace the lid and spread the sample around the plate by shaking the plate side to side.
8.	Dispose of the glass beads in the glass waste
9.	Incubate plates at room temperature. The plate will be checked for growth approximately daily.
