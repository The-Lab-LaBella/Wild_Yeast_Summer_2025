# June 11th - Diluting and Plating

This week we will be plating your liquid culture onto solid Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) plates.

## Background

### YPD

YPD is a "complete" medium, meaning that it contains everything most yeast need to grow. 

The typical makeup of YPD is
- 1% Yeast Extract - Busted open yeast cells containing essential nutrients like amino acids, peptides, vitamins, and carbohydrates
- 2% Peptone - Partially digested proteins from meat, plants, or yeast. The main components are tryptophan, lysine, arginine, histidine, methionine, and phenylalanine.
- 2% Glucose - Sugar source

### Liquid vs solid culture

**Liquid Culture Uses**
- Uniform access to nutrients and aeration
- Large-scale growth
- Quantitative growth at lag, log, and stationary phase

**Liquid Culture Phenotypes**
- Flocculation - cells that clump together and settle out of the culture.
- Filamentation - shift to elongated cells that form filaments.
- Biofilm - a community of cells that attach to a surface.

**Solid Culture Uses**
- Isolation of pure colonies
- Easier to handle, store, and transfer
- Observe phenotypes such as size, color, texture, and more.

**Solid Culture Phenotypes**
- Colonies come in many different sizes, shapes, colors, and textures.
- Smooth - colonies usually made by _S. cerevisiae_
- Spoked - colonies with radial structures
- Ringed - colonies with rings of growth
- Lacy/Coralline - colonies with raised uneven surfaces
- Mountainous - colonies with raised surfaces
- Velvet - colonies with velvety surfaces
