# Genome Assembly

This tutorial will walk you through how to assemble the Nanopore genomes sequenced by Plasmidsaurus 

If you want to learn more about how Nanopore sequencing works there are lots of informative videos here: https://nanoporetech.com/platform/technology 

This tutorial will only cover the bioinformatics parts of the analysis. We will discuss the background information in person. 

## Step 1 - Set up your folder

In either your home or scratch directory create a new folder with your genomeID. I will use ABB_052825_01_A as an example throughout 

```mkdir ABB_052825_01_A```

Then move into that directory using `cd`


```
