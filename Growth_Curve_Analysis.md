# Growth Curve Analysis

We previously added yeast to a 96 well plate and let them grow for 2,154 minutes! 

Now we need to measure how fast and how much our yeast grew. 

We will analyze this data in R - if you are already familiar with R, R-Studio, and R-Markdown you can skip to the analysis steps

## R, R-Studio, and R-Markdown

If this is your first time using R and R-Studio follow these instructions to get you set up

### Download & Install R-Studio

### Practice in R-Studio

### Set up & Practice R-Markdown
We will be using R-Markdown in this tutorial.

## Growth Curve Analysis

You will need 3 files for this analysis:

1. `wild_yeast_growth_curve_analysis.RMD` which is the R-markdown file [file](https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/Wild_Yeast_Summer_2025/blob/main/wild_yeast_growth_curve_analysis.Rmd)
2. `combined_curve.tsv` tab-delimited file containing our growth rate data [file](https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/Wild_Yeast_Summer_2025/blob/main/combined_curve.tsv)
3. `strain_sample.txt` contains the names of each well [file](https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/Wild_Yeast_Summer_2025/blob/main/strain_sample.txt)

All three files should be placed in the same directory. 

Open the RMD file in R-studio and walk through the tutorial. 

## Report your findings

Fill in your data to see whose yeast grew the fastest!
