# Introduction

If this is your first time connecting to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster or your first time connecting to our HPC, this guide will help you connect and get ready to assemble our genomes. 

If you are completely new to the command line, here are some websites to review before you begin

# Getting Connected

High Performance Computing Cluster
You will need access to the HPC here at UNC Charlotte. If you had access in a class this will not be sufficient for our work. You will need to request a research account by going to this link https://services.help.charlotte.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=140

Make sure you also ask for access to /projects/labella_lab

The HPC has some help pages but I've put together a quick-start HPC guide here: https://github.com/The-Lab-LaBella/Welcome_to_the_Lab/blob/51e711fc28308f657b9648db7fc7e7ff8d9fc557/HPC_getting_started.md#submitting-jobs-to-the-cluster
