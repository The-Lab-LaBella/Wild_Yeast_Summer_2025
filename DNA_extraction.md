# Day 0 – Yeast Growth 
The day before the extraction, a culture of your yeast will be grown for you. This will be timed in an attempt to have mid-log phase growth on Day 1 of the experiment. 

# Day 1 - DNA Extraction

Materials Required
-	Autoclaved YPD liquid medium

1.	Blank the spectrophotometer if you are the first to use it.
  a.	Add 1mL of YPD to the cuvette
  b.	Place the cuvette in the spectrometer and press ‘ZERO’
2.	Add 1mL of your sample to the cuvette
3.	Record the OD600 of your sample

OD Reading: ___________________________


## STEP 2 - Measure Cell Count

Required Materials
-	0.4% trypan blue
-	4 x 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube
-	Cell counter chamber

1.  Label your microcentrifuge tubes with your sample ID and either a D (dilution) or T (trypan blue)
2.	Add 500 µL of your cells and 500 µL of water (a 1:2 dilution) to the 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube labeled D
3.	Add 10 µL of trypan blue to the microcentrifuge tube labeled T
4.	Add 10 µL of your cell suspension (D) to the tube labeled T
