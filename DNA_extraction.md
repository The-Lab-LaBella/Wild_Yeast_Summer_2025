# Day 0 – Yeast Growth 
The day before the extraction, a culture of your yeast will be grown for you. This will be timed in an attempt to have mid-log phase growth on Day 1 of the experiment. 

&nbsp;

# Day 1 - DNA Extraction

## STEP 1 - Measure Cell Count

Required Materials
-	0.4% trypan blue
-	4 x 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube
-	Cell counter chamber

1.  Label your microcentrifuge tubes with your sample ID and either a D (dilution) or T (trypan blue)
2.	Add 500 µL of your cells and 500 µL of water (a 1:2 dilution) to the 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube labeled D
3.	Add 10 µL of trypan blue to the microcentrifuge tube labeled T
4.	Add 10 µL of your cell suspension (D) to the tube labeled T
5.	Mix the sample by pipetting up and down
6.	Gently add 10 µL of the sample to the cell counter chamber

7.	Leave the chamber on the bench for 30 seconds
8.	Insert slide into slide adapter until it clicks. The instrument reads one side of the slide at a time, so insert the sides appropriately.

9.	Select Rapid capture in the machine
10.	Record the Trypan Blue Corrected Total 
11.	 If the concentration is less than 1 × 104 or greater than 1 × 107 cells/mL, you will need to re-analyze your sample with a new dilution

## STEP 2 - DNA extraction

### Cell collection

Materials Required
-	Cold PBS
-	2 pre-chilled 50ml Falcon tubes
-	2 re-usable 50ml Falcon tubes labeled BALANCE

1.  Label your 2 sample 50ml Falcon tubes with the sample IDs
2.	Add _______mLs (from above) of your cell culture to a pre-chilled 50-ml Falcon tube. 
3.	Add _______mLs (from above) of water to a 50-ml Falcon Tube labeled BALANCE
4.	Centrifuge at 3,000g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
5.	Remove as much supernatant as possible and dispose of it into a container with 10% bleach
6.	Resuspend the pellet in 10 mL ice-cold PBS
7.	Centrifuge at 3,000g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
8.	Remove as much supernatant as possible and dispose of it into a container with 10% bleach

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## STEP 4 - Spheroplast (Cells without a cell wall) collection
Materials Required
-	Cold Spheroplast Buffer: 1M sorbitol, 1X PBS pH 7.4, 0.1 M EDTA
-	Zymolyase (5U/μl)
-	30°C incubator
-	1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
-	Cold PBS

1.  Label your 1.5 ml tubes with your sample IDs
2.	Add 500 µL of Spheroplast Buffer to your yeast pellet
3.	Gently resuspend the pellet
4.	Transfer the resuspended pellet to 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube
5.	Add 10 μl Zymolyase (5U/μ)] 
6.	Pipette up and down to mix with a wide-bore tip to mix.
7.	Incubate at 30°C for 20 minutes.  
8.	Invert and gently flick tubes every 5 minutes to keep cells suspended in solution.
9.	Gently pellet spheroplasts by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 300 x g
10.	Remove the supernatant.
11.	Using a 1000 µl wide-bore pipette tip, gently resuspend the spheroplast pellet in 200 µl of cold PBS.
