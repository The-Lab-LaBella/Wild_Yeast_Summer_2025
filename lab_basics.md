## Autoclaving (SOP & Hands-on)

Autoclaves **are dangerous** and can be used only by individuals trained in their use. 

To use the autoclave in our lab you must read and sign off on our SOP and review the safety materials here.

Once you have reviewed the autoclave safety please arrange to meet with Dr. Dineen or Dr. LaBella for in-person training

## Aseptic Technique (Video & SOP)

In the lab we are typically trying to prevent contamination of our samples and prevent contamination of ourselves from the organisms we study. 

There are different types of contamination that we need to think about. 

### Preventing Microbial Contamination

Aseptic techniques are aimed at preventing contamination of our yeast samples with other microorganisms. Contamination can come from the air, your breath, your clothes, or your skin. Therefore, we try to protect our samples from all of those sources of contamination. 

Growing animal tissue is the most difficult type of cell culturing and requires very good aseptic technique. 

Watch this video about using the hood to prevent contamination https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOi7YyVqahY 

### Preventing RNase Contamination

There are enzymes all around that can degrade or destroy the RNA that we are trying to work with. These enzymes are called RNases. Watch this video about how to prevent RNase Contamination

## Biohazard and other waste disposal (Video & SOP)

The yeasts that we are culturing must be disposed of properly. This means that the yeast must be killed before they can be placed in a normal waste stream or they must be disposed of in a biohazard. 

Watch this video on waste disposal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXqcGc_1794

**NOTE** protocols in this video are general and may be superseded by the laboratory SOP for waste disposal.
