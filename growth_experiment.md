# Growth Experiment & Glycerol Stocks

This week, we are going to set up a growth experiment with your two yeasts and save your yeast for the future in a glycerol stock. 

The day before this experiment, a YPD liquid culture was established using a single colony from your plate. You will use this liquid culture today. 

## Glycerol Stocks

We want to store the yeast collected for future experiments. We want to freeze the yeast so they can be revived later. 

We will use **glycerol** as a cryoprotectant. This protects the cells by preventing the formation of ice crystals. 

## Growth Curves


## Glycerol Stock Protocol

**Required Materials**
- Yeast culture
- Sterile PBST 20%, Glycerol 0.1%, tween 20
- Sterile MiliQ water
- 2mL Cryotube


**Protocol**

1. Label cryotubes with your sample ID. This MUST BE LEGIBLE 
2. Spin down the culture at 4C for 5 minutes at 3,000xg
3. Wash the pellet with sterile MiliQ water and spin down at 4C for 5 minutes at 3,000xg
4. Using a P1000 pipette, resuspend the biomass in 1.5mL PBST 20%, Glycerol 0.1%, tween 20
5. Add the resuspended biomass to the cyrotube and transfer to the -80 freezer

## Growth Experiment 

**Required Materials**

- Autoclaved MiliQ water
- Autoclaved 1.5mL microtubes
- Shared 96-well plate & assigned wells

**Formula**

C1 x V1 = C2 x V2

- C1: is the initial concentration (or OD600 value) of the stock solution.
- V1: is the volume of the stock solution needed.
- C2: is the desired final concentration (or OD600 value).
- V2: is the desired final volume of the diluted solution.

therefore

V1 = (C2 x V2) / C1 

Volume of Stock ________μL = ( 0.0001 OD600 x 700μL ) / ________ OD600 reading

Volume of YPD___________μL = 700μL - Volume of Stock ________μL


**Protocol**
1. Label your 1.5mL microtubes with the sample IDs
2. If you are the first in your group, add 1 mL of YPD liquid culture to the cuvette. Place in the spectrometer and press "ZERO"
3. Add 1 mL of your sample to a cuvette and place it in the spectrometer to measure OD600.
4. Record your OD600 measurement in the formula above
5. Dilute your sample to 0.0001 OD600 by adding ________ μL of sample to _____ μL of YPD to create a 700μL dilution in a 1.5ml microtube
6. Add 200 μL of diluted sample to each well assigned
