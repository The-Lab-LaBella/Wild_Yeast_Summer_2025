# Growth Experiment & Glycerol Stocks

This week, we are going to set up a growth experiment with your two yeasts and save your yeast for the future in a glycerol stock. 

We will also need to set up tubes for growing your yeast up for next week's DNA extraction. 

The day before this experiment, a YPD liquid culture was established using a single colony from your plate. You will use this liquid culture today. 

&nbsp;

## Glycerol Stocks

We want to store the yeast collected for future experiments. We want to freeze the yeast so they can be revived later. 

We will use **glycerol** as a cryoprotectant. This protects the cells by preventing the formation of ice crystals.

## Growth Curves

**Lag Phase**
- This is the period of time when the microbe is adjusting to new conditions
- Lag phase can vary due to technical differences or the ability of the microbe to adjust

**Exponential Phase**
- This occurs when the population is doubling.
- The slope of the line provides information on how quickly the cells are doubling.

 **Stationary Phase**
 - Lack of nutrients, accumulation of waste, or lack of space can cause the cells to stop growing exponentially
 - Cells will change their physiology at this point to adapt to starvation conditions

**Metrics From Growth Curves**
- Length of lag phase
- Growth rate or slope of the exponential growth period
- Doubling time or the time it takes for the population to double in size
- Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarize the overall growth (rate and duration)
- Centroid - hypothetical point on the curve that represents the "center of mass" and summarizes the magnitude and timing
- Max Growth or the highest OD read

# STEP 1
## Set up Cultures for next week

**Required Materials**
- 4 14mL culture tubes
- YPD

 **Protocol**
- For each of your samples, label 2 14ml culture tubes with the sample ID
- Put one for each sample in the rack for next week
- Add 10mL of YPD to one tube for each sample*
- Add 100μL of yeast culture to the labeled tube*




&nbsp;

# STEP 2
## Growth Experiment 

**Required Materials**
- Autoclaved MiliQ water
- Autoclaved 1.5mL microtubes
- Sterile YPD
- Shared 96-well plate & assigned wells

&nbsp;

**Formula**

C1 x V1 = C2 x V2

- C1: is the initial concentration (or OD600 value) of the stock solution.
- V1: is the volume of the stock solution needed.
- C2: is the desired final concentration (or OD600 value).
- V2: is the desired final volume of the diluted solution.

therefore

V1 = (C2 x V2) / C1 

Volume of Stock ________μL = ( 0.0001 OD600 x 700μL ) / ________ OD600 reading

Volume of YPD___________μL = 700μL - Volume of Stock ________μL

&nbsp;

**Protocol**
1. Label your 1.5mL microtubes with the sample IDs
2. If you are the first in your group, add 1 mL of YPD liquid culture to the cuvette. Place in the spectrometer and press "ZERO"
3. Add 1 mL of your sample to a cuvette and place it in the spectrometer to measure OD600.
4. Record your OD600 measurement in the formula above
5. Dilute your sample to 0.0001 OD600 by adding ________ μL of sample to _____ μL of YPD to create a 700μL dilution in a 1.5ml microtube
6. Add 200 μL of diluted sample to each well assigned

# STEP 3
## Glycerol Stock Preparation

**Required Materials**
- Yeast culture
- Sterile PBST 20%, Glycerol 0.1%, tween 20
- Sterile MiliQ water
- 2mL Cryotube

**Protocol**

1. Label cryotubes with your sample ID. This MUST BE LEGIBLE
2. Add 1.5 mL PBST 20%, Glycerol 0.1%, tween 20 to each tube.  

Dr. LaBella will complete this on Thursday to give your cultures more time to grow
_3. Spin down the culture at 4C for 5 minutes at 3,000xg_
_4. Wash the pellet with sterile MiliQ water and spin down at 4C for 5 minutes at 3,000xg_
_6. Add the resuspended biomass to the cyrotube and transfer to the -80 freezer_
