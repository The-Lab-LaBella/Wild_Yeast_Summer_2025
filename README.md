# Introduction

This summer, you will paricipate in the first wild yeast collection at UNC Charlotte. 

You **must read this thoroughly**! It contains important safety information. 

This is a collaborative effort between the LaBella, Carter, and Yohe labs. Please reach out to any of them if you have questions.

# Scientific Background

## The Y1000+ project
In 2024, Dr. LaBella and her colleagues in the Y000+ collaborative published a paper describing the genomic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity of the fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina. The yeasts in this group contains the common lab workhorse _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, the human fungal pathogen _Candida albicans_, and other yeasts used in biotechnology to create natural products and biofuels. 

This work sequenced the genomes of 1,154 yeasts - most of which are type strains found in repositories where yeast are stored. These genomes, however, do not capture the natural variation of yeasts in the environment around us. 

This project will expand our genomic dataset to include yeasts sampled here at UNC Charlotte.

## Yeasts

Yeasts are typically defined as single cellular fungi. Across the fungal subphylum, however, there have been multiple transitions to and from single-celled fungi. Therefore, the "yeasts" do not form a single group. When we use the word "yeast" we are referring specifically to the yeast of the Saccharomycotina subphylum. 

In our gooogle drive please read the "Who are the yeasts" PDF to learn more about who the yeasts are and why they are so cool.

# Biosafety training

Our lab is registered as a Bio-Safety Level 2 lab. This means that we are able to grow organisms, like _Candida albicans_ which can possibly infect people. If you are at an increased risk of infection we can increase your PPE protective equipment or find alternative experiments. 

To work in the lab you **must complete biosafety training**. Specifically the **Laboratory Personnel BSS** training. Instructions for how to take this course can be found here: https://research.charlotte.edu/departments/office-research-protections-and-integrity-orpi/biosafety/biosafety-training-information/

You will also need to review our specific biosafety protocol located on Google Drive. Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZKfBEeVSiTNbXMYxc7CZZ0bgad2wRc7/view?usp=drive_link 

## Essential Biosafety Rules

Here we will outline some of the most essential biosafety rules. If we observe you violating any of these rules, your access to the lab will be immediately suspended. 

- Do not enter the lab unsupervised. Exceptions must be approved by Dr. LaBella or the relevent PI
- No eating or drinking is allowed in the lab
- Do not wear lab coats, gloves, or any other protective equipment outside of the lab
- Use protective equipment (PPE) where required
- Follow all of the guidelines in the lab and institution biosafety, laboratory biosafety and environmental health and safety (EHS) protocols

## LaBella Lab Environmental Health & Safety Manual 

You must review and then sign a physical copy of our laboratory EHS manual. A copy can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Q_9g7UkfkQCxjsH2HckuvDxuQMfjhIr/view?usp=drive_link
