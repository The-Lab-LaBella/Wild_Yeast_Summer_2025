# WILd YEAST PROJECT

# Introduction

This summer, you will paricipate in the first wild yeast collection at UNC Charlotte. 

You **must read this thoroughly**! It contains important safety information. 

This is a collaborative effort between the LaBella, Carter, and Yohe labs. Please reach out to any of them if you have questions.

# Scientific Background

## The Y1000+ project
In 2024, Dr. LaBella and her colleagues in the Y000+ collaborative published a paper describing the genomic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity of the fungal subphylum Saccharomycotina. The yeasts in this group contains the common lab workhorse _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_, the human fungal pathogen _Candida albicans_, and other yeasts used in biotechnology to create natural products and biofuels. 

This work sequenced the genomes of 1,154 yeasts - most of which are type strains found in repsotiroies where yeast are stored. 

## Yeasts

Yeasts are typically defined as single cellular fungi. Across the fungal subphylum, however, there have been multiple transitions to and from single-celled fungi. Therefore, the "yeasts" do not form a single group. When we use the word "yeast" we are referring specifically to the yeast of the Saccharomycotina subphylum. 

In our gooogle drive please read the "Who are the yeasts" PDF to learn more about who the yeasts are and why they are so cool.

# Biosafety training

Our lab is registered as a Bio-Safety Level 2 lab. This means that we are able to grow organisms, like _Candida albicans_ which can possibly infect people. If you are at an increased risk of infection we can increase your PPE protective equipment or find alternative experiments. 

To work in the lab you **must complete biosafety training**. Specifically the **Laboratory Personnel BSS** training. Instructions for how to take this course can be found here: https://research.charlotte.edu/departments/office-research-protections-and-integrity-orpi/biosafety/biosafety-training-information/

- [ ] Completed the Laboratory Personnel BSS Training

You will also need to review our specific biosafety protocol located on Google Drive. Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZKfBEeVSiTNbXMYxc7CZZ0bgad2wRc7/view?usp=drive_link 

- [ ] Review and sign the laboratory biosafety protocol

## Essential Biosafety Rules

Here we will outline some of the most essential biosafety rules. If we observe you violating any of these rules, your access to the lab will be immediately suspended. 

- Do not enter the lab unsupervised. Exceptions must be approved by Dr. LaBella or Dr. Dineen
- No eating or drinking is allowed in the lab
- Do not wear lab coats, gloves, or any other protective equipment outside of the lab
- Use protective equipment (PPE) where required
- Follow all of the guidelines in the lab and institution biosafety, laboratory biosafety and environmental health and safety (EHS) protocols

## Autoclaving (SOP & Hands-on)

Autoclaves **are dangerous** and can be used only by individuals trained in their use. 

To use the autoclave in our lab you must read and sign off on our SOP and review the safety materials here. 

Review Autoclave Safety: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T901F2W7wks

Once you have reviewed the autoclave safety please arrange to meet with Dr. Dineen or Dr. LaBella for in-person training

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Aseptic Technique (Video & SOP)

In the lab we are typically trying to prevent contamination of our samples and prevent contamination of ourselves from the organisms we study. 

There are different types of contamination that we need to think about. 

### Preventing Microbial Contamination

Aseptic techniques are aimed at preventing contamination of our yeast samples with other microorganisms. Contamination can come from the air, your breath, your clothes, or your skin. Therefore, we try to protect our samples from all of those sources of contamination. 

Growing animal tissue is the most difficult type of cell culturing and requires very good aseptic technique. 

Watch this video about using the hood to prevent contamination https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOi7YyVqahY 

### Preventing RNase Contamination

There are enzymes all around that can degrade or destroy the RNA that we are trying to work with. These enzymes are called RNases. Watch this video about how to prevent RNase Contamination

## Biohazard and other waste disposal (Video & SOP)

The yeasts that we are culturing must be disposed of properly. This means that the yeast must be killed before they can be placed in a normal waste stream or they must be disposed of in a biohazard. 

Watch this video on waste disposal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXqcGc_1794

**NOTE** protocols in this video are general and may be superseded by the laboratory SOP for waste disposal.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Hemocytometer (Video)

One of our main goals will be to count how many cells are in a specific amount of our sample. To do this we will use a Hemocytometer.
